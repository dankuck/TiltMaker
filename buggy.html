      This page creates a configuration for the board game Tilt
      and finds all unique solutions for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tilt is a single-player game consisting of a 5&times;5 board with
      green sliders (G), blue sliders (B), stationary blocks (+)
      and a goal in the center (O). The player's objective is to
      tilt the board as necessary to make the green tokens fall
      in the goal while keeping the blue tokens out. Tilt comes
      with 40 configuration cards. This page generates new 
      configurations.

    <p>
      If you have the Tilt game, you can try the configuration
      out yourself. It may help to run the solution generator
      to check first if there actually <em>are</em> any
      solutions.
